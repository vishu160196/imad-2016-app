            Oh yeah!! so hi all, the name's foo, and probably you know me too!!! that rhymes bub doesn't it? thankyou, thankyou I know I
            am cool!!!! So I heard the dev's making his first webapp, and decided to jump in too. Trust me bro this guy is way cooler than 
            you can imagine. He started his journey with POP and is now jumping to OOP (a natural progression isn't it). He has made some really
            cool stuff and is on a rampage when it comes to programming. Oh and yes I heard madi saying there's some animation on the main page
            !? I didn't see any.....maybe the dev's having a hard time with animations, though i did see 2 canvases on the main page.......

            So if you wanna party hard and code harder press the LIKE button below and don't forget to mention a comment about the cool guy
            I've been talking of for so long!!!! *Ruff Ruff* *Ruff Ruff* *Ruff Ruff* *Ruff Ruff* *Ruff Ruff*!!!!!

        <p class="paragraph">
            P.S. The last few lines cannot be translated since they contain strong language which is inappropriate to display.....This dog is a
            real riot.
